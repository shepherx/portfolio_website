                <p>Hi - my name is Ian Shepherd and I am a lover of all things relating to computers and art. I guess that is why
                    I naturally gravitated towards the field of Web Development. I am a senior at Colorado State University with a major
                    in Computer Science with a concentration in computer programming. After finishing up at CSU I will be attending the
                    University of Denver for a MS in Web Development. The programming languages I am familiar with are JavaScript, CSS, HTML, Java,
                    Python, and have dabbled into a few others. I love playing video games like World of Warcraft and hanging out with my pitlab Scratch.
                </p>
